# mylib

**mylib** is a helper library with algorithms and data structures that I reuse
in personal scripts and program.

It is made for my personal needs so if you use it be aware that it may change
at any time. But well, the API will be pretty stable because changes to it
leads to a multitude of my personal scripts and programs breaking. I chose to
put it up on github both to make it easier for myself to reuse it in my
programs and to share with others.

Other OS's than Linux are not supported. Some things may work, some may not. I
haven't tested.

# Getting Started

Add this line to your dub configuration:

```sh
dependency "my" version="~>0.0.2"
```

Done! Have fun.

Don't be shy to report any issue that you find. I mean, if you find a bug then
I definitely wants to know about it because it affectsd me as much as you!.
